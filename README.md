### How can I use this?

[See the wiki](https://github.com/ardaozkal/ownshot/wiki).

### Can I use this on Windows/Linux/macOS?

Windows? Yes.

Linux/macOS? mono binaries should work BUT if you have a PHP server and don't want to use ftp and stuff, you can use the experimental ownshot.sh. Just set the configs and install https://github.com/ardaozkal/PHP-FileUploader on your server.

Enjoy!
